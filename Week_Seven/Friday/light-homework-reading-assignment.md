## Start thinking about your Lightning Talks!

Lightening talks are 5-10 minute talks on technologies not covered in class done by you! We will do one a day starting Thurday Feb 1st.
Please do give some real time and thought into these (but probably no more than a day's work). We know there is a lot else to do, but these are important too.
The more effort you put in, the more you and your classmates will get out of them.

These will be going through week 10. You can the day you wish to present as long as it is between now and the end of week 10.
There isn't a hard deadline to pick a topic, but you can't pick a day without picking a topic too. Note that both days and possibly topics you are interested in may be taken up. (No two students can present on the same day, or on the same topic).

When picking something, keep in mind you will be expected to build something (something very tiny, think hello world, for some things) with the tech you are presenting. So if you pick "the blockchain", its a good idea to have a relatively accesible tutorial in mind first. (I have total faith that that can be done, and it would be awesome, so I don't mean to discourage you!)

To sign up for a topic and day, please reply in the thread to the Slack message where you got this assignment!

Thanks!
