Websites are awesome! But when things go wrong and sites go down we need to communicate a 404 (Not Found) error message to the user.

A 404 error is a standard HTTP error message code that means the website you were trying to reach couldn't be found on the server. It's a client-side error, meaning either the webpage was removed or moved and the URL wasn't changed accordingly, or the person just typed in the URL incorrectly.

Design a custom 404 page that you will use in projects from now on.
Make it unique by adding features to it.

## Turn the user error in to a UX (User Experience) opportunity.
## Perhaps you can suggest something, or add links to something else.
