# Problem Solving - Afternoon Lab

1. For this assignment, we'll get back into pairs.
2. Write a program that implements your pseudo coded peanut butter and jelly sandwich process
3. For every step of suedo code, write a function that will `console.log()`what that step does

### Bonus
1. Try to find a way to add a delay between each function call

### Example
```javascript
 function openJamBottle(){
    console.log('Opening Jam Bottle');
}
```
