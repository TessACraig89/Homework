### For today's homework we'll be incorportating everything we learned in today's lessons / labs
- Continue building your full CRUD app using Node and Express.
  * CRUD: Create - Read - Update - Destroy :thumbsup:
- In addition to what we built for 'lessons' in our app, let's build an additional resource for our app.
  * Create an additonal resource, i.e. model file, routes file, and views directory with ejs templates.
- Make your new resource about one of your favorite things i.e. favorite sport, hobby, food..etc.
  * Review all the components of your lessons resource for guidance on connecting the pieces for your new resource.
- Focus on the functionality and basic rendering of your data in the templates first.

### If you have time you can work on adding styles, IMGs, and anything else you'd like to practice with :sunglasses:
